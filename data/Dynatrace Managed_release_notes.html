<h2 style='text-align:left'>New features and enhancements</h2>
<h3 style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Cluster resilience improvements</h3>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>- To prevent a data loss in case of a severely undersized disk for Transaction and Session Replay storage, the cluster node will disable OneAgent traffic on itself and will no longer accept incoming data. For example, this might be a result of a disk size misconfiguration. At startup, the cluster node won't be able to start successfully. You'll receive a dedicated cluster event when such a situation happens.</p>
