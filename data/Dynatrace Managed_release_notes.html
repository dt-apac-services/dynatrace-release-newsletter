<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Published date: 2022-10-12</p>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>These release notes relate to Dynatrace Managed specific changes. To learn about general Dynatrace changes included in this Dynatrace Managed release, see:</p>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>- Dynatrace SaaS release notes version 1.252 and Dynatrace SaaS release notes version 1.251</p>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>- Dynatrace API changelog version 1.252 and Dynatrace API changelog version 1.251</p>
  
<h2 style='text-align:left'>Announcements</h2>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>- CentOS/RHEL/OL 8.2, CentOS 8.4, CentOS 8.5, Suse LES 11.4 operating systems are no longer allowed to install new cluster nodes. Dynatrace Managed version 1.258 will be the last one that you can upgrade at one of these operating systems.</p>
  
<h2 style='text-align:left'>New features and enhancements</h2>
<h3 style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Predictable data retention management</h3>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>When there's not enough free disk space to store new data, the Dynatrace Managed cluster automatically adjusts the retention times of data stored in Elasticsearch and transaction storage if both are placed on the same disk partition. The data retention adjustment is applied equally to all environments in the cluster.</p>
<h3 style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Application Security threat intelligence automatically updated</h3>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>To ensure you always have up-to-date Dynatrace threat intelligence in the Application Security module, third-party vulnerability feed metadata is automatically downloaded from Mission Control. If you have enabled Application Security, you can't opt out from downloading the metadata—it's an essential part of this solution. Feeds are downloaded on demand. You can audit each successful and failed attempt on the Cluster Management Console Events page.</p>
<h3 style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Improved SAML-based SSO configuration</h3>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>The HTTP Content Security Policy (CSP) form-action directive restricts the URLs that can be used as the target of form submissions from a given context. If there is a redirect from the Identity Provider (IdP) to other hosts during sign-in or sign-out, you can add them in the new configuration input field.</p>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'></p>
<h3 style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Upgraded JRE</h3>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>To take advantage of performance improvements, the latest security-vulnerability enhancements, and bug fixes, we've upgraded JRE for the following cluster node components:</p>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>- Cassandra and Elasticsearch now use JRE 8u345</p>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>- Other components now use JRE 11.0.16.1</p>
<h3 style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Improved email validation in CMC</h3>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>When setting up user accounts and notifications, you can now use email addresses with a single letter in a top-level domain.</p>
<h3 style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>Simplified file structure of Dynatrace Managed installation</h3>
<p style='text-align:left;margin-left: 25px;'>When a custom Linux system user is used to run Dynatrace Managed services, there was a custom directory created under the user's home directory (/home/<user running managed>/.javacpp/cache/). This is the technical directory that was moved to /var/opt/dynatrace-managed/.javacpp/cache/ to ease the management of the deployment.</p>
